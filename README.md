# Galaxy-Space-Shooter
A version of the galaxy space shooter game


Things I've done to the game

-- Implemented Singleton pattern and Object Pooling pattern
-- Differentiated between Player 1 and Player 2 lives display
-- Designed a new UI for main menu and pause menu 
-- Enemy Shoots if they respawned again after reaching the limit of the screen
-- Esc is the key for opening the pause menu
-- Enter is the key for shooting in Player 2
-- Changed (Variable == false) to (!Variable) And (Variable == true) to (Variable) to reduce the usage of memory
