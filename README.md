# Galaxy-Space-Shooter<br/>
A version of the galaxy space shooter game
<br/>
<br/>
Things I've done to the game<br/><br/>

-- Implemented Singleton pattern and Object Pooling pattern<br/>
-- Differentiated between Player 1 and Player 2 lives display<br/>
-- Designed a new UI for main menu and pause menu <br/>
-- Enemy Shoots if they respawned again after reaching the limit of the screen<br/>
-- Esc is the key for opening the pause menu<br/>
-- Enter is the key for shooting in Player 2<br/>
-- Changed (Variable == false) to (!Variable) And (Variable == true) to (Variable) to reduce the usage of memory<br/>
<br/>
